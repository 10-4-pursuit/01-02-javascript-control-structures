# JavaScript Control Structures

## Objective
Understand and practice using control structures in JavaScript, such as loops and conditionals.

## Instructions
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Create a file named `control-structures.js`.

## Tasks
1. Write a 'for' loop that prints numbers 0 to 4, each on a new line, in the format 'Number X', where X is the current number.
2. Modify the 'if-else' statement from the previous exercise to include a new condition. If the `name` is 'Bob', print 'Hello Bob!'.

## Submission
Commit and push your `control-structures.js` file to this repository. Ensure it includes the 'for' loop and the modified 'if-else' statement.
